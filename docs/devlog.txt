* successfully removed pixel.* modules which sped up program significantly. it's now running at minimum 50fps whereas before
it was around 5fps. 
* getting rid of the mallocs each frame dramatically sped up the program!
* now just need to implement barycentric coords again to rasterize the triangles properly
* also need to implement zbuffer to cull backfaces

* spent a while trying to debug zbuffer stuff. got stuck because i don't know exact position of camera (pos z inf or neg z inf?)
* eventually got someting working but it appears to chop the bunny in half (probably something to do with negative values)
* need to debug further. demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DxiqoNhu3OlH_KBBLPmDgHHxaBPGjX8/view?usp=drive_link
