* successfully removed pixel.* modules which sped up program significantly. it's now running at minimum 50fps whereas before
it was around 5fps. 
* getting rid of the mallocs each frame dramatically sped up the program!
* now just need to implement barycentric coords again to rasterize the triangles properly
* also need to implement zbuffer to cull backfaces
