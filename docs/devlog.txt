* successfully removed pixel.* modules which sped up program significantly. it's now running at minimum 50fps whereas before
it was around 5fps. 
* getting rid of the mallocs each frame dramatically sped up the program!
* now just need to implement barycentric coords again to rasterize the triangles properly
* also need to implement zbuffer to cull backfaces

* spent a while trying to debug zbuffer stuff. got stuck because i don't know exact position of camera (pos z inf or neg z inf?)
* eventually got someting working but it appears to chop the bunny in half (probably something to do with negative values)
* need to debug further. demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_DxiqoNhu3OlH_KBBLPmDgHHxaBPGjX8/view?usp=drive_link

* there are some visual artifacts on the 3D render. I used a very simple lighting model to flat shade the .obj. 
* The artifacts include random horizontal and vertical lines. Will debug today. demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bPZyXsM5UkKR6BHqA6qJ0xTAO5pDQ1xs/view?usp=drive_link
* ok i fixed the artifacts. i now want to have look at texturing the bunny. i want to spend some time researching and understanding how 3D objects are usually textured in memory.

* there are two main things to work on from here. fragment shader / textures / material and perspective correction. 
* the latter requires studying the maths a bit more deeply - going into the various vector spaces and the relevant transforms
* the former requires understanding textures, fragment shaders and materials better
* I've decided to focus on perspective correction
