write a color module which wraps around sdl2 functions, is intuitive and easy to use
- maybe even decouple window module and wrap around sdl2 for display functions and separate main logic from that

general refactoring and unit testing (clean code)

multithread obj parsing (using some sort of divide and conquer approach). 
- it takes too long when the file is too big (300MB for example)

refactor triangle.h so that struct Triangle is obsolete and it is just treated as an int[] relative to a vertex[]

get rid of unecessary allocs in render_triangle. write directly to framebuffer to improve performance
